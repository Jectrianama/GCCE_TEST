# GCE_TEST


 In this work, we propose a  Generalized Cross-Entropy-based framework using Chained Deep Learning, termed GCECDL, to code each annotator’s non-stationary patterns regarding the input space while preserving the inter-dependencies among experts through a chained deep learning approach. by combining the power of deep learning with a noise-robust loss function to deal with noisy labels. Besides, network self-regularization is achieved by estimating each labeler’s reliability within the chained approach.
